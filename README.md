"Namehub" is a simple application that allows you to search for an awesome name for your next project/startup. Just type the keyword in the Searchbox and it will suggest you different names based on your keyword. You can also click on any of the suggested names and it will redirect you to namecheap.com where you can verify whether the domain name corresponding to that name is available or not.
